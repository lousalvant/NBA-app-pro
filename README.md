## Notes

I had difficulty with the navigation bar. When trying to add functionality to the navigation bar using a Layout route, it would break my code and would cause everything on my page to disappear. I wanted the user to be able to return to the dashboard after clicking on a player and viewing the player details in the detail view. I used the same home button that was used in the lab and I was able to get it to work without breaking the rest of my code.
